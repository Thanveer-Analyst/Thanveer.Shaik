    <h1>Research Experience</h1>
    
    <h2>Research Project 1: Remote Patient Monitoring via Non-invasive Digital Technology using Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>From 2020 to Present, I have been working on adapting AI methodologies in monitoring hospitalized patients’ suicidal tendencies in an acute mental health facility. Using non-invasive digital technology, near-field coherent sensing (NCS) allows patients to perform daily tasks without direct skin contact. Successful implementation of this project would enhance patient care and assist medical staff and doctors in hospitals.</p>

    <h2>Research Project 2: Educational Decision Support System Adopting Sentiment Analysis on Student Feedback</h2>
    <p>From 2021 to Present, I have been focusing on analyzing teaching practice and learning environments by processing unstructured student feedback and forum posts. This project aims to design and develop a decision-making support system to improve the operational effectiveness of teaching and learning across the university.</p>
